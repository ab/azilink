This program uses Ant to compile.  Just run "ant" for a list of compile options.

Steps to compile:

1) Edit local.properties to point to the Android 1.5 SDK.
2) Make sure you've got ant installed
3) Run "ant debug" to generate the binaries!

If you want to use Eclipse, be sure to add systemprop.jar as an external library.
